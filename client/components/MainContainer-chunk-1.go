It seems like you've provided a React component written in JavaScript. Unfortunately, it's not possible to directly convert this code to Go, as Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language primarily used for system-level programming, while React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

If you need to build a web server in Go, you can use the `net/http` package to serve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. However, the user interface code will still need to be written in JavaScript or a similar front-end language.
