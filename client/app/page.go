It's important to note that Go and React (JavaScript) are fundamentally different languages and serve different purposes. Go is a statically-typed, compiled language primarily used for backend development, while React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

However, I can provide you with a simple Go web server that can serve your React application. You'll need to build your React app and place the build files in a folder named "public" in the same directory as the Go file.

Here's a simple Go web server:

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("public"))
	http.Handle("/", fs)

	log.Println("Listening on :8080...")
	err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

To use this, save the code in a file named `main.go` and run `go run main.go`. Your React app should be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
